# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Pewlett Hackard is a large company with over 300,000 employees. As the baby boomers began to retire, the company is preparing for the furture in 2 ways 1) offering a retirement package for eligible employees and 2) considering position fulfillment.  As part of the effort Bobby and I have been tasked with determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. [^1]



## Results
As part of the effort, specific criteria was set to determine an employee's eligibility information; review current employees only whom were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.

Based on the criteria set forth and additional information we determined the following:
- A total of 72,458 current employees are eligible for retirement.
- Senior Engineers (36%) and Senior Staff (34%) account for the majority of employees eligible for retirement. We would need to focus a significant amount of training in these positions.
- There are 2 Managers eligible for retirement as such we
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. There would need to be an increase in mentors to ensure adequate coverage for each area.
